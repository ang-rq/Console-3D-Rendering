# Console 3D Renderer

Console SDF renderer using raymarch.
You can move around the world with _'wasd'_ and _SPACE_ or _SHIFT_, or look around using the arrow keys.
Made without external libraries, should work out of the box.

Make sure to maximize your console window. You can change the resolution by modifying the global _h_ parameter, lower it if things don't look right.

You can make your own scenes (and putting them in the _GetDist()_ function) using the existing primitives, or implement your own.
